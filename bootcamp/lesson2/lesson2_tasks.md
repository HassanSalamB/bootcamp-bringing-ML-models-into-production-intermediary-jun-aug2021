# Bringing ML Models into Production Bootcamp
# Lesson 2: Batch Inference

Watch the recording of this lesson [here](https://youtu.be/G1qxR1Hi3i8).

## Goal

The goal of this lesson is to learn more about:
- machine learning lifecycle building blocks in action
- Batch inference on Azure

---
## 1. Register ML model
### Steps

1. Register a new version of the same model via cli
2. Register another model via cli
3. Optional (register another model via Python script)

---
## 2. Attach and remove AML cluster

### Steps

1. Choose more powerful AML cluster and attach it to the workspace via cli
2. Remove this AML cluster from the current workspace via CLI
3. Optional (attach and remove AML cluster via Python script)

---
## 3. Schedule Azure Machine Learning pipeline

### Steps

1. Schedule the pipeline to run every day at 08:00 in the morning
2. Schedule the pipelune to run every 3 days at 13:00
3. Optional (schedule pipeline via ....TODO)

---
## 4. Homework

**Goal**

Get hands-on experience with machine learning buidling blocks and batch inference on Azure

1. Follow the steps in Deployment setup to train, evaluate and register Ridge model.
2. Follow the steps in Batch inference on Azure to setup and schedule Azure Machine Learning pipeline
