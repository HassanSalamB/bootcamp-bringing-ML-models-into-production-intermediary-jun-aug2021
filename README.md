# Welcome to Python Bootcamp Bringing ML models into production
 
## Bootcamp description
6 week-long hands-on Python Bootcamp following a real-life industry scenario. Teaser: itâ€™s all about energy :)

After finishing this bootcamp you will know:
* machine learning project lifecycle building blocks
* machine learning model deployments scenarios
* how to prepare your machine learning model for deployment
* hands-on with batch and real-time serverless deployments on Azure
* best practices, common mistakes to avoid during the deployment process

In this repository you will find: 
* The content to follow our live sessions with home assignments

## Prerequisites
- git
- docker
- bash shell (git bash on Windows, bash on Linux, zsh on Mac)
- Miniconda (or Anaconda)
- Visual Studio Code
- Hands-on Python data science related experience
- Some modeling experience with scikit-learn library is a pre
- Active Azure subscription 

## Out of the scope
- deep learning model deployments
- deployments in different programming languages than Python
